# This is a collection of my personal configuration

This is my personal configuration. I use this every time I get a new machine.
It works on macOS and Linux(arch). On a clean macOS machine just run `./install.sh` and it will install everything

# TODO

- Os aware install script for easier installation on clean linux installs distribution.
- Arch install script that installs deps from the boot drive
