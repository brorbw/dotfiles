# This is a collection of my personal configuration

This is my personal configuration. I use this every time I get a new machine.
It works on macOS and ~Linux(arch)~. On a clean macOS machine just run `./script/install.sh` and it will install everything

# TODO

- ~OS aware install script for easier installation on clean linux installs distribution.~ (nah)
- ~Arch install script that installs deps from the boot drive~ (nah)
